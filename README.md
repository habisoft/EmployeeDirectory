# EmployeeDirectory
Implement a directory of employees given their name, salary, ID, and reporting manager ID. Implemented in Python 3

The Employee class is an object for storing an employee's
name, salary, employee ID, and their reporting manager ID.

The Manager class is a derived class from the Employee class
that inherits all the properties of the base class but adds
a member variable for storing a collection of employees.

Both of the classes above are implemented using Python 3. The
scripts can be run indepently, and in this case wold trigger
a self test. Ensure the scripts are made executable:

chmod a+x Employee.py
chmod a+x Manager.py

The scripts are tested under CentOS 7, therefore, the Python 3
path specified at the top of the sript might have to be edited
to accomodate the environment.
